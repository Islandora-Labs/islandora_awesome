### Create a pull request

Take a look at [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). In a nutshell you
need to:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) a given Islandora Foundation component repository at [https://github.com/islandora](https://github.com/islandora) to your personal GitHub account. See [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for detailed instructions.
2. Commit any changes to your fork.
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the Islandora GitHub repository that you forked in step 1. If your pull request is related to an existing JIRA issue -- for instance, because you reported a bug/issue earlier -- then prefix the title of your pull request with the corresponding issue number (e.g. `ISLANDORA-123: ...`). The branch name should also correspond to the JIRA issue number.

You may want to read [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) for instructions on how to keep your fork up to date with the latest changes of the upstream (official) `islandora` repository.

Community members who have push/merge permissions on a repository should **never** push directly to a repo. 

### Merging Pull Requests

In Islandora Labs, the policies for merging may be different from the standard Islandora [Committer's Workflow](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/wiki/Islandora-Committers-Workflow). These policies are set at the discretion of the Current Maintainer, as defined in this project's README.md.

In this project, the following policies apply:

* The maintainer(s) of this module, and any Islandora Committers, have merge privileges.
* Merging one's own pull requests is permitted for Islandora Committers.
* Formal github review is not required, nor is a courtesy waiting period required. Entries should be reviewed for compliance with the [Islandora Community Code of Coduct](https://islandora.ca/codeofconduct).
